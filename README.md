# Bayesian Modeling Mechanistic Systems

This repository provides code for reproducing results in *Dynamic Bayesian Learning for Spatiotemporal Mechanistic Models*.

To reproduce results in the application section of the paper, simply go to ./vignettes and run the file in the subdirectory, for example ./vignettes/emulation/emulate_EP_MNIW.R. The results will be generated in ./figures.
